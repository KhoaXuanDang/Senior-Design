### Project Overview
This project is a **microservice-based web application** designed for University of Cincinnati (UC) students. The platform allows users to share, collect, and manage recipes within a dedicated digital cookbook. Students can contribute their own recipes, browse submissions from peers, and curate a personalized collection, creating a centralized and collaborative culinary resource for the campus community.
