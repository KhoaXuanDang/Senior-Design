# User Stories for the Recipe Sharing Web Application

As a **UC student looking for new meals**, I want to **browse recipes submitted by other students** so that I can **find quick, affordable, and easy-to-make dishes**.

As a **home cook**, I want to **contribute my own original recipes**, so that I can **share my favorite dishes with the university community and receive feedback**.

As a **user curating a digital cookbook**, I want to **save recipes I find to a personalized collection**, so that I can **easily access and organize my favorite meals in one place**.

As a **recipe creator**, I want to **edit and manage the recipes I've submitted**, so that I can **correct mistakes or update my recipes with new information**.
